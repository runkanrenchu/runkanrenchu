## Hi there! üíú

I'm Runkan Renchu, Alex for short.

I'm currently working on **School**, a personal project, and **Max Doesn't Know**, a platformer game in early-development stage.

I'm learning [Haxe](https://haxe.org/). I use [Flixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) for all of my work.

I started game-dev because I want to contribute to the gaming community with all of my ideas and enthusiasm, in the form of these small web games.
I have a passion for all tech-related stuff. And I thought it was time I could pour some of my creativity in these projects, that ended up being
more than just a hobby. ‚ú®

You can find me on my [itch.io page](https://renchuaintreal.itch.io/), were I post WIPs of my stuff.

### Personally...

I don't mind any pronouns!

I speak English and Spanish. Spanish is my main language.

Fun fact: I own two cats. Their names are Luna and Alexa :)

I'm also an animator and a digital artist. I'm kind of a music guy too.

My favourite colour is purple. 


## Thanks for reading. Have a picture of Luna. ‚ù§Ô∏è
